# learn R from those who use R daily
many years you have to go the fee of the masters to learn. 

with github, masters share their code so you can learn alot about how they write good code and their coding phylosophy.

here's a few people who write R codes
1. Marcin Imeilski lab @ NYU
 Anything from the lab. take a loot at the `gutils` package. `flow` and `mskitools`. his disciples also write r codes and you can adapt their writing style
2. Gavin ha lab @ Fred Hutch Cancer center
Take a look at his `ichorCNA` piepline for cfDNA detection for inspiration
